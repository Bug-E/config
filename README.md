- This contains my preferred settings/config files for various utilities like vim/git/bash.

.mvn: For enabling build cache extension on a maven project. It ensures tests always run even when the caching is enabled.
This is useful as it becomes troublesome when tests do not trigger even when you want them to due to build cache. Better is to specify when you want to ignore tests via mvn args.

.vimrc: Some productivity configs.

iterm profile: Profile with hotkey config and custom fonts.
